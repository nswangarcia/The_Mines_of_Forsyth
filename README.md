# The Mines of Forsyth

Welcome to The Mines of Forsyth.
This is a command line base dungeon crawler game build with Java and Gradle.

## Design Patterns
In this project I plan to use the Structural Pattern - Decorator for creating different types of monsters, weapons, and potions, or can be used for creating different level cycles.
The Adaptor pattern will be used for changing the state of a player or monsters health, possessions the player has and so on.
The Behavioral pattern of Stategy can be used for creating subgroups of monster types or weapons as well.
